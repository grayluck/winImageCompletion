## Dependencies

This project can be built by Visual Studio 2012. Project description file included. Currently it is for Windows only.

You need to have the following libraries in your computer. 

- OpenCV 2.4.8 or later
- Eigen 3

`EIGEN_DIR` which points to your Eigen root directory, and `OPENCV_DIR` which points to your OpenCV root directory should be in your environment variables list.
